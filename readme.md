# Personality Quiz 
Take this short peronaility quiz and go on a journey to see who you are. This quiz was inspired by the popular japanese cube
personaility test. Instead of copying the exact questions they asked, I created similar questions. The quiz is short, so it might not 
tackle all your characteristics. This project was made using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. HTML and CSS were used to make the landing
page as well as the backgrounds, and JavaScript was used to give an answer back for the option the user chose. 

## Getting started
1) Download the zip and extract all the files and folders
2) Open login page.html to get to the landing page
3) From there press begin to start the quiz
4) Have fun =)

## Acknowledgements 
*Inspired by the popular japanese cube personaility test
*Followed "Online Tutorials" to understand how to make a rotating wheel for the landing page. I modified it a bit to look a little bit different. </br>
